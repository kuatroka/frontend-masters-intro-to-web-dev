Here is your first HTML project!

We're making your personal blog. Feel free to use the project we started in the last lesson. Here are your requirements

- Your blog has two pages: index.html and about.html
- Your index.html needs a title and a quick intro.
- Your index also needs a link to about.html.
- You blog must have five posts on it (you can just keep it all on the same page).
- Each post needs:
  - A title
  - An author
  - The date it was posted (feel free to make up times)
  - The text of the blog post. Bonus points if there are multiple paragraphs. Feel free to use [Lorem Ipsum][lorem] if you want placeholder text.
  - Bonus points for images.
- Your about.html needs
  - The name of your blog
  - A few paragraphs about you
  - A list of your recent jobs/schools/accomplishments

Quick note on how to do an image: put the image in the same directory as the index.html and about.html and then put `<img src="the-name-of-the-file.jpg" alt="a text description of what the image is for sight-impaired folks" />` to render the image.

This will mostly be black and white and that's okay. You can come back and restyle this later with CSS.

Here is my example: [Brian's Blog][html] (you'll have to right click and say "View Source")
